# K&R C (2nd Edition) - First Reading Notes

## Introduction
This repository documents my first reading of **"The C Programming Language (Second Edition)"** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. The book is a classic in programming literature, introducing the C language concisely and effectively. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of C programming and its fundamental concepts through structured reading and exercises. I will also be taking notes on paper, so this repository is just for the book excercises. 

## Goals
- **Understand** the core syntax and semantics of the C language.
- **Practice** writing C programs by working through book exercises.
- **Analyze** key programming concepts such as pointers, memory management, and data structures in C syntax.
- **Document** learnings and common pitfalls for future reference.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run C programs, I am using gcc. In the respective directories organized by chapter, I will compile and execute with the following commands:
```sh
$ gcc filename.c -o exec/filename
$ ./exec/filename
```

## Notable Console Commands
To reach EOF on an input stream:
- **On Windows**: Ctl+Z
- **On Linux/Unix**: Ctl+D
